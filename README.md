# Recommender-Systems-LightGCN-

Machine Learning on Graph Final Project

In this project, we reviewed some papers from basic methods to a neural network method. In the end, we learn about Light-GCN, which actually improved former methods by simpilifying GCNs. For detailed information, see main.ipynb .

For Implementation, we used this repository : https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders . All of the files in "recommenders" folder come from this repo.
